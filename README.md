# Vending Machine
Vending Machine assignment for the Introduction to Python unit. Written to display our understanding of basic Python programming, software design and development and Object Oriented Programming.

## About the Project
An interactive program (text-based) that is to be installed in a vending machine and act as its operating system. The vending machine is used to dispense various products after they have been paid for by the user. The user is able to select a number of products and pay for them at the end of the transaction instead of paying for multiple products individually. The program tracks the coins inputted and coins available for change as well as current inventory available.

### Built With
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

The program is written using Jupyter Notebook, this was to allow me to ease into learning this new technology and develop my understanding of Object Oriented Programming using Python. The main challenge for myself in this project was the modularisation of the program into its classes, in other programs I have written the classes have been easier to distinguish.


## Getting Started
If you want to run this project, make sure you have [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) installed and have cloned this repository. From there, simply open the vending_machine.ipynb file and run all cells.
